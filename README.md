# Obsidian event stream

The [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) tool is my daily note-taking tool that I use for my personal knowledge management.

> I've created a course if you are not familiar with that tool: https://www.pawelkowalik.com/obsidian/

It has a great infinite **canvas** area that supports: cards, links, colours, markdown. So everything I need to visualise the event streams from different systems. 

## The genesis

I've always missed a tool for learning and visualising new systems and events from that systems that I needed to integrate into.

Task: learn how system X works, what events it has and which of those are really important.

## The solution

This project is a solution for my problem. 

Features:
- listens to event stream
	- websockets
	- webhook
	- TBD
- saves all received data
- visualise all events on the [Obsidian canvas](docs/Obsidian%20canvas.md)
## Alternatives

There is also the [GT - Glamorous Toolkit](docs/GT%20-%20Glamorous%20Toolkit.md) software that also can visualise quite nicely. But I prefer dotnet (for now) and I don't know the GT that much. Maybe later I will rewrite this to GT. We'll see.
