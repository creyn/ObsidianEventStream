The [Obsidian canvas](docs/Obsidian%20canvas.md) allows for few types of entities:
- cards
- notes from the vault
- web pages - it is rendered inside the canvas
- media from the vault
- group
- links

Plus there are some properties of those entities (like colours).

The sample canvas looks like this:
